    "description": "The hex bar deadlift is a variety of deadlift performed in a hexagonal barbell also known as a trap bar. The bar is held with a parallel (palms in) grip outside of the legs. It is biomechanically different from a barbell deadlift in that it lines up with a lifter’s center of gravity, rather than placing it in front of their body. The trap bar deadlift can be trained in traditional strength and muscle-focused rep range, or for higher reps. It activates all of the same muscle groups as conventional or sumo deadlifts, including the glutes, quads, hamstring, lower back, lats, upper back, and grip."

    "description": "The bear crawl donkey kick is a more advanced version of the bear crawl exercise that adds a donkey kick. It adds an extra coordination and shoulder challenge to an already intense full-body movement that targets the cardiovascular system as well as a wide range of muscle groups, the shoulders, core, and legs in particular. It can be done as a full-body warm-up, in short bursts for power or circuit training, or for longer durations as cardiovascular conditioning."
